# How to Fix the Conflicting Files Error

The deployment is failing because there's a conflict between files in the `pages` directory and the `app` directory. Next.js is detecting both routing systems being used simultaneously, which isn't allowed.

## Error Message
```
Conflicting app and page file was found, please remove the conflicting files to continue:
"pages/index.js" - "app/page.tsx"
```

## How to Fix

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Look for the `app` directory at the root level
3. Delete the `app/page.tsx` file or the entire `app` directory
4. Commit the changes with a message like "Remove conflicting app router files"

## Alternative Fix

If you can't find the `app` directory, you can:

1. Upload the updated `next.config.js` file we just modified (which explicitly disables the App Router)
2. Create an empty file at `.nojekyll` in the root of your repository to ensure GitHub doesn't process your files with Jekyll

## After Fixing

After making these changes:
1. Go back to Vercel
2. Click the "Redeploy" button
3. Your deployment should now succeed

The updated configuration explicitly tells Next.js to use only the Pages Router, which should resolve the conflict.
